Tired of downloading the lecture notes manually. The python script helps you get all your lecture notes. 

Clone this repository on your local machine. 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the required python packages installed. Then update the fields in `details.json` (*NOTE*: Enter the course id as - `"course_id"2X`, where X is the unit digit of the academic year. While working on windows take care of the escape characters in the download directory. )

At last run, `python main.py` in the repo directory, and your notes will be donwloaded in the desired location.
